# OCI Package

NanoBus has a built-in command in the CLI, `nanobus push` that packages all the 
information needed to run a NanoBus application for distribution. This is based on existing 
OCI registry architecture and standards. Any standards-compliant OCI registry is able to support 
NanoBus application packages. For anyone without access to a standards-compliant OCI registry, Candle
offers a free NanoBus compatible registry at https://reg.candle.run.

# Package Spec
The package details are defined in the bus.yaml file of the application.

```
package:
  registry: reg.candle.run    #or your own registry
  org: myorg                  #this is the registry project/organization that will host the NanoBus package
  add:                        #the bus.yaml, apex.axdl, and referenced local WASM Iota are automatically added
    - ui/dist/                #Any static served files need to be in the `add` section
    - resources.yaml          #Any resource files need to be in the `add` section
    - migrations/sql          #Any initializers / migration files need to be in the `add` section.
```

# Credentials / Pushing
Currently, you need to have the credentials stored as environment variables (if you are not using the GitHub action).
```
export OCI_REGISTRIES=MYREG
export MYREG_HOSTNAME=reg.candle.run
export MYREG_USERNAME=<your registry username>
export MYREG_PASSWORD=<your registry password>
```

Then just run `nanobus push` and it will package all the files and upload them to the registry.  The name of the package will be created by following fields from your bus.yaml:

```
{package.registry}/{package.org}/{id}:{version}
```
If the `id` of an app was `example` and `version` was `0.1.0`, and contained the `package` values as defined above, it would be uploaded to:
```
reg.candle.run/myorg/example:0.1.0
```

# Push GitHub action
A github action is available for adding the Package + Push functionality directly into your CI flow: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/nanobus-push
