# Welcome to the Wick Framework Docs

Wick is a **revolutionary software development framework** designed for the modern era of application development. It brings a new level of **reusability, security, and scalability** to your projects, enabling you to build applications that can run on both server and client sides seamlessly.

## Key Benefits of Wick

1. **Security**: Wick uses WebAssembly to sandbox all dependencies, providing a secure environment for applications by restricting functionality to CPU only by default and isolating memory per transaction. Run third-party precompiled code securely without risking data exfiltration.
2. **Composability**: Connect Wick components together with a manifest, allowing for easy swapping of dependencies and efficient application building.
3. **Productivity**: With standardized interfaces, complex integrations become a thing of the past, making it easier to develop and maintain your applications.
4. **Testability**: Wick's test runner enables rapid unit testing on the command line, streamlining the testing process.
5. **Maintainability**: Wick allows you to scale and adapt your application independently, easily turning parts into microservices or worker instances.
6. **Versatility**: Wick allows you to run the same code on both server and client sides, reducing development time and effort while maintaining consistency across your application.
