# Running components in NodeJS

Wick's JavaScript client works the same in node.js as it does in the browser. The client is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@candlecorp/wick), and you can check out the repository on GitHub at [candlecorp/wick-js](https://github.com/candlecorp/wick-js).

The [node.js example](https://github.com/candlecorp/wick-node-example) project is a ready-to-execute demo of running a Wick WebAssembly component in node.js.

To get started, clone the example project:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:candlecorp/wick-node-example.git
$ cd wick-node-example
```

Install dependencies

```console
$ npm install
```

And run the example

```console
$ node index.js
```
