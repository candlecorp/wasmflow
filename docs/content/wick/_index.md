# Wick Documentation

Wick is an application runtime that allows you to stitch components together into web services, CLI apps, microservices, workers, anything. Wick was designed from the ground-up with **reusability** and **security** in mind. Wick is built with rust and WebAssembly to keep your code secure and portable.

## Key Benefits of Wick

1. **Reusability**: Write a component once, use it as a microservice, JSON Rest API, CLI app, or as part of another component for larger application without changing a single line of code.

2. **Productivity**: Wick makes it easier to develop, maintain, document, and test your applications. Test every component the same way, generate documentation with a single command, and update components without fear.

3. **Security**: Wick uses WebAssembly to sandbox dependencies and keep them isolated from one another. Wick's architecture makes it easy to keep vulnerabilities _out of_ code in the first place.
